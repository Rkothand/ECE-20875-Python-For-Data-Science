Problem1:
Step1:
	the null hypothesis is that 75% of the students will become knowledgeable 	about the course information

	the alternative hypothesis is that percentage of students who will become 	knowledgeable about the course information is not 75%

step2:

	engagement 0:

	the sample size is:1977
	the sample mean is:0.6399545077035914
	the standard error is : 0.005715989588773277
	the z-score is: -19.252220562568542
	the p value is: 1.352401028607762e-82

	the results are significant at 0.1, 0.05 and at 0.01

	engagement 1:

	the sample size is:937
	the sample mean is:0.7430304110448239
	the standard error is :0.004153027288269652
	the z-score is: -1.6781948375012814
	the p value is: 0.09330906925243751

	the results are significant at 0.1 and at 0.05

step3:

	engagement 0:

	maximum error in the given condition is 0.05614669104352599	
	
	engagement 1:

	maximum error in the given condition is 0.003555978074164272
step4:
	null:
	the mean engagement between engagement_1 dataset and engagement_0 datasets 	are different
	
	alternative:
	the mean engagement between engagement_1 dataset and engagement_0 datasets 	`are not different	
	
	we can test this by using the 2 sample test

step 5:
	the sample size of engagement_0 is:1977
	the sample size of engagement_1 is:937
	the sample size of both engagements together is is:2914
	the sample mean of the 2 sample test is:0.0282199990542063235
