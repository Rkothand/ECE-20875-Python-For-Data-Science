Problem 2:

Step 1:
we use the z-score test
with 90% confidence interval:
	
	sample size: 11
	sample mean: 8.181818181818182
	standard error: 5.337377942940253
	z score: 1.6448536269514722
	p value: 0.100000000000000009
	the confidence interval is [-0.5973872860378808, 16.961023649674246]
Step 2:
we use the z-score test
with 95% confidence interval:
	
	sample size: 11
	sample mean: 8.181818181818182
	standard error: 5.337377942940253
	z score: 1.959963984540054
	p value: 0.05
	the confidence interval is [-2.2792503582231944, 18.642886721859558]
Step 3:
we use the either the z or t test now because we know the standard dev, but I will use z:
	
	sample size: 11
	sample mean: 8.181818181818182
	standard error: 5.337377942940253
	z score: 1.959963984540054
	p value: 0.05
	the confidence interval is [-2.2792503582231944, 18.642886721859558]
this is the same as part 2 because the standard deviation was not implemented in any of the calculations, it only plays a role in t tests

Step 4:
